CLIENT AND SERVER MODEL : 

client : machine or process that request data from servers.
server : machine which provide data to client .

what happens when you search something on internet?

1. users access website through domain main and connects to DNS service which is third party service which provide ip address of the website that we want to hit .

2. once we have gotten the ip address , request will be send it server directly and response is returned in the form of HTML pages or json.

NETWORK PROTOCOL :

client and server communicate with each other through network protocol like IP , TCP,HTTP.

IP: INTERNET PROTOCOL

its a basic packet through which message(text,image,json etc) are sent from one machine to another . it consists of header and payload . header contains 
the address for source and destination whereas payload is actual message that you want to transport .

what if the size of messages are big?

there will be multiple ip packets which will be sent .

cons: if multiple packets are sent then we have to make sure that we are not missing any packets which is a drawback in internet protocol

TCP : TRANSFER CONTROL PROTOCOL

network protocol build on the top of IP for ordered and reliable data delievery.

HTTP: HYPER TEXT MARKUP TEXT

network protocol build on the top of tcp , which includes request and response.
